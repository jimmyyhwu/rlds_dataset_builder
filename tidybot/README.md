# TidyBot Dataset

Dataset of robotic household cleanup episodes from TidyBot real-world evaluation experiments. The task is to put each object into its appropriate receptacle. Each observation consists of an egocentric camera RGB image of the current object, the name of the current object, and the names of available receptacles. Each action specifies the selected receptacle. Note that there is no robot proprioception data.
